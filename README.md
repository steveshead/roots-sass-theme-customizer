Theme Customizer using the Roots (sass) Wordpress theme.
===========================

Wordpress Theme Customizer custom controls using the Roots (sass) Wordpress theme

The WordPress theme customizer allows you to edit the styles, look and feel of your WordPress theme and preview the changes you make in real time, without having to save the WordPress theme.

This is a starting point for the further development of the theme customizer and will require much work to tidy it up and further improve the funtionality, especially since I am an amateur at coding right now.

The theme used is Roots (sass) but doesn't need to be - it was a good starting point and can easily be decoupled if required.
